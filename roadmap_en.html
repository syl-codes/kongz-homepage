		<h4>Hello everyone, this is MetaKongz!!</h4>

		<p class="t1">
			<span>The first minting of 3,000 Kongz only took 32 seconds to be sold out; </span>
			<br /><span>the second 3,000 in five seconds and the third 3,500 in 6 seconds! </span>
			<br />Every Kongz was sold out with a phenomenal record.
		</p>
		<p class="t2">
			This marvelous achievement was possible most importantly because of 
			<br />your infinite interest and love for MetaKongz.
		</p>
		<p class="t2">
			Please continue to be with us in the future; 
			<br />we will always do our best to achieve globalization beyond Korea's representative NFT project.
